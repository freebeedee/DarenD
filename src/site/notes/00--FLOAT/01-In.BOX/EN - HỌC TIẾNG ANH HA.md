## TIPS FOR ENGLISH DIPPING IN
#Thought/onLearning

### A. Lexicon or connection of words

#### A.1. Vocabulary and whats not
Don't get bound too much by word spelling. Once we looking at how words work in our minds, even in Vietnamese it's rarely the 'spelling' or 'definition'. We 'see' images and the sounds of the words and the connection between them.

We reconstruct the stories in our temporary memory by adapting what-have-been-said into the context we perceived. Then, we comprehend what word means and try to decode what the speakers want to say.

All the process that engross into our hardwired memory the 'language collectives' - (the full set that contains characters, pronounciation, expression, emotion, meanings, images... virtually everything the words stand for.)

Therefore, we know for sure next time, in the similar context, the same set of sound and character can mimic the very image. Thus, delivery the meaning we want to express.

#### A.2. Context speaks louder than meanings themselves
Sacarsism 101. Have you watch F.R.I.E.N.D? I haven't.
You see what I mean? Yeah, of course.

When we first encounter new words or new expressions, try not to give it concrete meaning. Pay attention on the context in which it is used. Remember the context, remember the 'feeling' or 'concept' that it brings. Ultimately, in the similar context we can use this word to express the 'feeling' or 'concept'.

Please be noted that at this stage we only learn the surface of the words. We haven't got to know the word let alone fully comprehend it.

#### A.3. Remember the faces, not the font-face
Remember each and every expessions that happen inside, outside or co-relation of the new words. Everything, I mean, everything.

I remember when i first encounter the word "bucket", i was in an English class of a English Center on 3/2 street, i remember the teacher in red ao dai, she was a teacher of VUS but had a side hustle as a part time teacher in our English Center at that time. I remember the exact sit i sat on, the distance between me and the teacher. In the very exact moment she said "bucket". All that happen when I was in highschool, grade 10.

Note: I remember this case specifically because I have been using this as example for Greeting-the-words. Other examples are, the song, the temperature, the faces of the person using it.

#### A.4. Prefix, Sufix and Root:
Words in English have the complementary by which their "shape-shift" its meaning. Break down them into parts and memorize the meanings it holds.

Collectively, we would be able to 'invent' the word we need, the fun happen is when we invent the right word this way.

Let's note it here that I'll find the strong list of the root and fices for you later.

#### A.5. Vocabulary in the Expression
Beginer says: I don't know
Intermediate says: I have no idea
Advanced says: Beats me
Native says: How the f* that I know

=>Key take-away: the more 'advanced' in english, the less we have english bound us and the more we express ourselves.

Sometimes, we will find out that one same word, speak in different tones or eyes contact or facial expression can hold the whole universe different.

We have to find what natural way to express the ideas, which hopefully correct in terms of culture, otherwise people will get the wrong idea rightly.

However, don't rely too much on what we have already known. That would lock us into no-grow zone and we would be stuck into crappy English (forever).

#### A.6. Using Left hand and Right Brain
This is the method that couldn't be found any where else. We received advice to 'write down the words' for thousand times. Yes it works, but, no it doesn't help. Because, from above, vocabulary is nothing near the character that build up the words. Vocabulary is the underlaying that the words represent.

Yeah, How about using left hand to write? Funny idea, isn't it. But it works, and helps too. Why? Because it's trigger focus (different type of focus).

We will findout from time to time, different type of work require vary sorts of focus. Using left hand to write new word is the wake-up call for the section that's responsible for language reception (in the right brain).

Funny it is, the language producer is locate in the left brain, and the right brain hold the section for language receiving. Which is why, we found it always hard to speak out the fuzzy ideas as the left brain doesn't work well with the right brain.

By using left hand, we signal the right brain by the 'language' of the left brain and thus, form a team between the two.


### B. Pronunciation is the Key; Speaking is the Lock; Listening is the Treasure.

#### B.1. We can only listen to what we speak (or the optimization of sound library)
My secondary high teacher once told me a story "which way to Mexico".

Once there was a man came to the national highway. There, he met a policeman. He asked:
_ Sir, could you chow me which way to mè xí cồ please?
The policeman gave out the confused gaze: _ The what?
_ Mè xí cồ, the country. - the man replied
Policeman tilted his head with a frown:
_ Can you spell it?... ... ... Ah! Mé xì cồ!

This was the real story of her friend, when he travelled. From which I learned, that when we listen, we don't spell the word in our head. That's why the natives don't get the idea if we pronunce them wrong.

It works both way, imagine we got used to the wrong pronunciation, when the native speaks. We are dumbfounded in our head. Why?

We expect the pronunciation that match our memories, but it doesn't happen. This is when we start to 'update' our sound library in our head.

#### B.2. The comparation of contexts
We human brain doesn't built to perceive purely what we receive sensationally. We interpret the impression by compare what we listen to how we speaks.

Which means, if we want to be able to listen to natives, what we have to do is to talk to natives and use their set of language collectives (A1).

Or else we won't be able to decode the listened that match the speed in which it is spoken.

#### B.3. Concentrate to relax
Remember when we talk about language receptors? Yes, located in the right brain, which works with images, colors, feelings, and work best when we are relax.

So, imagine we are counting cars that pass by. We cannot focus on each and every cars that passed us. What we do, we fixate our mind's eyes into one point of the street (pretty much like a camera). Then, we set our minds into automatic mode that say:
_ For every car passes, count up 1.

This is what should happen in our brain when we listen. We set our mind that, for each sound that match the 'sound library' (B1) retrieve the 'language collectives' (A1) then understand it within the 'context' (A2).

Within that process, we let our imagination do the works, what we do is to ease down the left brain by loosely fixate our mind's eye into one place.

My tips, is the point in your head, between the ears.

#### B.4. Actively Listen
Expectation and anticipation or the guessing game.

Remember that we said, we should focus on relaxing and let the mind goes auto?

To be able to active find the answers for a preset of question; is quite the same as "counting the red cars that pass by". Which we guess when and how the speaker would talk about that, and pay attention to the clue that pop up which match the anticipated.


### C. Writing is fundamental for Reading and Speaking a like

#### C.1. Real Process of Reading: Thoughts and Ideas.
We are lost in the lines of text sometimes. Because we care too much on how the text is written but not the whole structure of the text.

You see, to effectively describe thoughts and ideas, we are to group them into section like what you have been reading here:
- A
	- A1
	- A2
- B
	- B1

You get the idea. And, if you pay attentions, the concentration of meanings and concepts are not spread evenly along the text, but to concentrate quite dense in one section to the next.

The Concepts are the holder of ideas, and the thoughts fill the space to effectively guide the readers going through the red thread and understand what it is the writer delivers.

Note well, not the paragraph or sentence. It's the thoughts and ideas that count.

#### C.2. To Read is to Write
Reading is always challenging because we don't have social cue in the text. No tones to listen to and no facial expression that help decoding the meanings.

So what happen is that we are to build the library to read by ourselves and guess what? The most effective way to build that library - aka language collectives - use in Reading is not "Read more!" as we are adviced. The true effective way is to write more; why? Because when we write, we compile the language collectives (A1) into texts and by that we remember that this 'container' (the text) can deliver this meaning.

Therefore, after each readings in english, what we have to do is to analyze the texts, break it down into basic concept and definitions. Then, reconstruct it by your own language.

We are not listen to what we hear, we listen to what we speak. It's somehow similar, we read well what we wrote alot about.

You see, the tone of the text is determine not by the sound it made, but by the frequency the text is found in social interactions. For example, we speak 'strife' publicaly, and 'try my best' friendly. We sometimes switch between the two to create other 'effect' in the speech. But it's rarely we heard someone say 'endeavour'. We can only find the word 'endeavour' mostly in the formal text or when potician express there efforts to reduce taxes.

#### C.3. The fussion of speaking and writing or Academic English.
IELTS Speaking is the fun process, in which, you have to allow yourself to think carefully, structure you speech thoroughly before saying the first words.

That is to say, You have time to write down what you need to say in your mind (or a provided piece of paper) before speaking.

This way, you have to do what i call: Using writing to speak. You heard that right. We structures our speech as if we are about to write it down and deliver in the manner of speaking.

This is the very effective method to sharp your thinking as well. The more blurred the line between writing brain and speaking brain, the smarted you sounds and the easier for you to express complicate ideas.

### D. Multi-Dimension of Language

#### D.1. Unlock the brain by giving up mother tounge
 This is funny. The time I got myself more confident in English is actually when I used it to learn other languages. 

I have tried: Japanese, Korean, Pali, Sancrit, German, Spanish, Italian, French, Hebrew. Only French, Korean and Japanese I studied 'officially' in the centers. The others, I taught myself by whatever works.

That was the time of grade 9 (i remember have to go to internet service near my secondary shool to learn, i was broke that time). You see, the ages where internet is new in Vietnam, we don't have any profound vietnamese resources to learning languages other than english.

So I have to give up my mother touge in the effort of comprehend the other language by english. Somehow, english became my 2nd mother touge that way.

#### D.2. The benefit of real-time interpreting
There were boosters in my English journey. Being a semi-pro interpreters after highschool was one of them.

Real-time interpreter means that when the natives say whatever they have to say, you say whatever meaning it might match in the language in check. I was be doing that both way from En to Vi and back.

Guess what, we don't translate words by words we got the ideas, work the context and reconstruct the story and tell it again in different language.

The exact moment we find out that the language is not what is written or spoken, it is how the ideas transform and transfer. When we reach the flow of back and forth linguisticly. We develop something I call the linguistic sense.

And, oh boy, that helps.

#### D.3. From Tongue to Touge
I remember first time learning Japanese and successfully construct a ful sentence in Japansese. That night i dreamt about using the english, japanese way. That is to think backward.

You hear me right, the whole process of thinking goes backwards. That feels like you think 'left handed'. And this is way too fun. Because later i found out that, when I produce some poem or rap lines, my brain get into similar flow of thinking.

I do hope it can speak itself clearly. Say, the process of moving from touge to touge release yourself from the concrete of words and sentences. Thus, move you forward to the state in which you can articulate more sublte objectives like feelings, colors...

That would open the lexicon to poetry horizon

### E. SUMMERING UP

#### E.1. My English Day
So, this is what I did for the English to dip in:
- Almost 24/24, listen to podcasts and musics, these would sinks down and provided me a firm foundation in which I could filter out the context in social interactions.
- Read one article.
- Write what i can relate from the article i read, then.
- Speakout - alone, without looking at the paper.
- Last but not least, I set my schedule for an 2nd foreign language study in the centre or self learning on the internet.
- Once in a while, I watched movies, series and tried to mimic their lines.

#### E.2. Last words, with time and exposure, everything sinks.
Make sure that time is on our side not against us. Try to expose yourself actively. Remember to buildup your lexicon the right way. Build the language collectives not the collection of words and spellings.

And with time you will see, we human learn naturally without effort.

##### Only learn what commonly used:
I never search the dictionary for the word that appear for the first time. Instead, I greet the words and try to understand from the context.

Only and only that I meet the word three times forth, I decided to 'learn' the word comprehensively:
- I look it up the dictionary. 
- Break them down into complementary parts (roots, prefix, suffix).
- Make use the words on my next writing
- Repeat the pronunciation of it fast. I mean, so fast that i twist my touge about it.

##### Greeting the words or "Hey you again!"
This is where I use psychologic cue to remember the word. I connect it with the context that the word appears into, the context of the last time it appear.

Remember everything that happen around myself when I learn the word; it's raining, in the coffeeshop, the song I listened.... whatever that to make the impression of the word heavy enough for it to automatically sinks down to my memory. But not the meaning from dictionary. Doing that while saying mentally: Hey you!
 
##### Look it up in Dictionary:
I used paper dictionary for this job. I looked the word close down to each characters, recreat it in the mind (write it again in my mind) and search the paper dictionary without looking back at the word again.

The best way to remember is to reconstruct, I found.

##### Life-recording moment: when we recall from what's 'almost' lost
Come time, we can barely remember the word that is supposed to work in the situation. The vocabulary you don't remember. You want to say this, you trace back to memory and founded-dumb. This is when everything written in this Tips started to help. I called them the life-recording moments. This is crucial moment:

- Don't give up early, don't google, don't ask for help.
- Concentrate to relax.
- Recall by the feelings, connections, contexts, search the sound library, all language collectives. 

If you have connect enough the word with enough impression that help the word sinked to your hard wired memory. You will be able to recall it. And right after that. You will never forget that word again. It's the brain magic.
